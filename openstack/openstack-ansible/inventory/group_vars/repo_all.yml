# The following package must always build from source.

# libvirt-python:
# A pre-built wheel can be missing libvirt capabilities from the installed
# version of libvirt-bin, leading to nova-compute failing to start.
#
# NOTE(hwoarang) cryptography may bundle openssl in the wheel and that
# causes symbol conflicts if a different openssl is provided by the
# distribution. As such, it's probably safer to re-build cryptography
# ourselves just to be sure that the correct distro libraries are used
# see https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/3804
# This keeps popping up every now and then so it might worth keeping this
# around even if the upstream issue is resolved
# The upstream issue should be resolved now, and we are testing
# cryptography with the usage of wheels by removing it from no_binary.
