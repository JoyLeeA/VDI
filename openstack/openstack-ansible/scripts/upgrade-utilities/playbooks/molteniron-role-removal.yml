    # The molteniron service is not an official OpenStack project, and
    # has been removed from the integrated build. It can still be optionally
    # added, but due to the fact that it was previously integrated we need
    # to remove it during this major upgrade to ensure that the repo build
    # process does not try to build its wheels.
