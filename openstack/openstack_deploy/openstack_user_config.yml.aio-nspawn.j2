# NOTE(cloudull): This section and is only present as a way to show how blocks
#                 can be used to to simplify config when hosts serve multiple
#                 roles. In this case the AIO block is defined once and used
#                 for all other components without needing to duplicate config.

      #                   network without any manual intervention. In a
      #                   poduction setup with VLAN tagged interfaces or
      #                   multiple nics this would not be required.

      #                 + The "vxlan" network configuration option is provided
      #                   so test instances can be built using l3 networks. In a

      #                   be used and should already have an IP address assigned
